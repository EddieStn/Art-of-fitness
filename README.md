# Local development

## Forking and Cloning

## Forking a repository
### A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the EddieStn/Art-of-fitness repository.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Fork**.

## Cloning your forked repository
### Right now, you have a fork of the Art-of-fitness repository, but you do not have the files in that repository locally on your computer.

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to your fork of the Art-of-fitness repository.
2. Above the list of files, click  **Code**.
3. Copy the URL for the repository.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:
    * `$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Art-of-fitness`
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
